# About
This simple project connects an ESP32 directly to an HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor. It was used for demonstration purposes for CU Boulder's 2024 Robo workshop.

The actual project moved to [RyanDraves/robo-24-workshop](https://github.com/RyanDraves/robo-24-workshop) due to the overhad of Bazel-ifying the ESP32 tooling.
