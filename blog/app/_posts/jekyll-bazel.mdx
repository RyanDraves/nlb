I decided to build a blog, and like any engineer with a passion for tooling, I decided to do so in a ludicrously time-consuming way.

Introducing a Jekyll site built and run with Bazel!

Like all projects, I like to learn a few new things as I progress through it, so I claim no expertise in the following:
- Ruby
- Jekyll
- Writing Bazel rules

which is incidentally nearly every part of this project.

# How it works

## `rules_ruby`
The first step is getting Ruby set up with Bazel. Looking at the [Jekyll quickstart][jeykll_docs], we'll need to install:
  - Ruby
  - Bundler (through Ruby)
  - Jekyll (through Ruby/Bundler)

[rules_ruby][rules_ruby] can do all of this for us. Quite conveniently, some of the features we need were recently implemented, like [exposing runnable targets][rules_ruby_hermetic_commands] of the gem binaries. This lets us run stuff like `jekyll new [...]` (via `bazel build @ruby//... && ./bazel-bin/external/rules_ruby~0.6.0~ruby~bundle/bin/jekyll new [...]`) without a separate local installation of those tools to get the project set up. A similar command to Bundler was needed to get `Gemfile.lock` generated.

At the time of this writing I set up `rules_ruby` version `0.6.0` with an installation as documented nicely in the repo's README.

## Jekyll setup

I kept the initial Jekyll setup very bare-bones compared to what's created from `jekyll new`. There are a few key differences to get Jekyll and Bazel happy about each other.

### `webrick` missing
For one reason or another with the dependency setup, `webrick` was missing but needed by Jekyll. Adding the gem fixed it:
<CodeBlock lang="ruby" name="Gemfile">
{`gem "webrick", "~&gt; 1.8"`}
</CodeBlock>

### `_config.yml` excludes
The Jekyll build process involves running without a sandbox (`execution_requirements = \{"no-sandbox": "1"\}`; a necessity of how the gems and runfiles are structured), so there are a few Bazel paths we need to exclude files in the same folder that aren't part of the site.

<CodeBlock lang="yaml" name="_config.yml">
{`exclude:
  # Exclude Bazel Stuff
  - bazel-out/
  - external/
  # Exclude files not part of the site
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - README.md
  - BUILD
`}
</CodeBlock>

## `rules_jekyll`

The interesting part of the setup is the glue between having Ruby & gems installed with Bazel and getting the site built with Bazel.

The `jekyll_site` macro I made works by taking in the following:
- The Jekyll binary target, so we have something to execute in our macro's actions
- The sources of the site
- The `_config.yml` file target, so we can pass it along in the arguments

With those inputs, the macro produces a few targets:
- A target to call the Jekyll binary and build the site
- A target to create a small script that wraps the Jekyll binary and sorts out runfile locations
- An executable target to call the previous script

With this setup we get a clean interface to either `bazel build` or `bazel run` our site. Targets for this macro are also quite simple:
<CodeBlock lang="python" name="BUILD">
  {
`jekyll_site(
    name = "site",
    srcs = [":sources"],
    config = "_config.yml",
    jekyll = "@bundle//bin:jekyll",
)
`}
</CodeBlock>

While I haven't tried it, I imagine an auto-reload would be quite simple to achieve. Since the build action is separated, running this under [ibazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-watcher) should trigger rebuilds that the running server can pick up.

# The journey there

The final implementation is pretty different from the meanderings that got there. I'll reflect on a few of the more interesting points of that process.

## Jump Scripts
I wasted a lot of time making scripts to run a hermetically installed tool back in the original workspace, i.e. one that "[jumps][jump_script]" back to user's CWD when running `bazel run` in order to edit local files. This would be really useful for commands like `jekyll new` (instead of fishing results from `bazel-out`), but the development effort wasn't worth it over making a proper rule that can cache the build. I got things working on older versions of `rules_ruby`, but the newer updates (which enabled the proper setup anyways) also enabled similar functionality if you pass in absolute paths.

## `rules_ruby`
`rules_ruby` was greatly simplified the project scope and was fun to set up. However, since I was pulling in changes from active development to get some features I needed, I ended up churning through a lot of implementation as I played around with what was possible to set up.

After the jump script adventures I spent a good while trying to write a Bazel rule that depended on `@ruby//:jekyll`. I [learned](rules_ruby_issue), with the patient help of the `rule_ruby` maintainer, that I was running things in a non-hermetic / unintended way, that `no-sandbox` would fix the issues I was having using the intended `@bundle//bin:jekyll` target, and that my rule could just be a macro calling `bazel_skylib` or `aspect_bazel_lib` rules. Most of the heavy lifting in the project was learning these 3 lessons (as well as the exorbitant amount of time spent on the learning curve of making Bazel rules)

# Next Steps

I should definitely start actually writing something now or making the site look nicer. That's probably a good next step.

After that, there are a few goodies that would clean up the tooling a bit:
- Test `ibazel` for auto-reload of the site
- Make new jump scripts to avoid fishing the tools out of `bazel-bin` to run them back in the workspace
- Look into Jekyll plugins to extend the features of the site
