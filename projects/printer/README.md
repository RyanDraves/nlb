# Print files for Ender 3 3D printer

## Pi 3B Printer Case
Case to mount a Pi 3B alongside the printer, from this [Thing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4713922).

## Bed Leveling Sequence
Bed leveling sequence for the printer. The extruder visits each corner and pauses. I recommend inserting a piece of paper for a level test before the extruder comes down on each corner. Hand tuning is still needed afterwards, so don't expect a great first layer on the next print.

This is from [AlliedToasters/ender_3_bed_level](https://github.com/AlliedToasters/ender_3_bed_level) as a fixed version of the CHEP bed leveling sequence.

## Skew Test
Test print [Thing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2948908) that makes for a nice level check. Make sure the clips on the build plate aren't in the way for this one or you'll probably damage the print head :/
