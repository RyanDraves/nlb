# Print files for Ender 3 3D printer

## Pi 3B Printer Case
Case to mount a Pi 3B alongside the printer, from this [Thing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4713922).

## Bed Leveling Sequence
Bed leveling sequence for the printer. The extruder visits each corner and pauses. I recommend inserting a piece of paper for a level test before the extruder comes down on each corner. Hand tuning is still needed afterwards, so don't expect a great first layer on the next print.

This is from [AlliedToasters/ender_3_bed_level](https://github.com/AlliedToasters/ender_3_bed_level) as a fixed version of the CHEP bed leveling sequence.
