Hello, nlb!

This is a packaged release of the Python `nlb` modules in the namesake [nlb](https://github.com/RyanDraves/nlb) monorepo. Due to unfortunate naming collisions, this package is published as `nl-blocks` on PyPI, however it is imported as its canonical `nlb` name.

Docs? No thanks. Here's a simple directory tree until ReadTheDocs is setup:
