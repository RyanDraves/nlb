This is a streamlined version of the main [nlb package](https://pypi.org/project/nl-blocks/) that supports Python 3.10. This package is published as `nlb-legacy` on PyPI, however it is imported as its canonical `nlb` name.

Docs? No thanks. Here's a simple directory tree until ReadTheDocs is setup:

nlb<br />
├── sharetrace -> Library & CLI to share Python tracebacks<br />
└── util -> Utilities<br />
